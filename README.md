## [Text classification](https://github.com/alexpetr0v/natural-language-processing-course/tree/master/lab1)

The laboratory work is based on the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/unn-nlp-2021-classification/leaderboard). The task is to classify the text. It is necessary to predict the quality of a post on StackOverflow based on its content. EDA was carried out during the solution, classical vectorization methods (tf-idf, BOW), pre-trained embeddings (w2v, GloVe) were used, classifiers from classical machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest), as well as deep learning methods were used.

## [Text generation](https://github.com/alexpetr0v/natural-language-processing-course/tree/master/lab2)

The task is to text generation. It was necessary to collect your own data set. Using the [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quicktour), train an NLP model on a dataset and get some fun, unique prompts.
